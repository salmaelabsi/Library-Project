Please noter the following things regarding this code
1-In order for it to wok you need to change the information of the database inside the script of most classes
2-Java swing was used in order to cope with low end pc's as they tend to have a low end cpu and gpu.
3-Set Mysql java connector in order for the code to work and connect to the datbase.
4-We have for the time being 3 classes:
	-UserLogin: Can be accessed as soon as you run the code.
Logs the user to the Home page. For the 1st iteration we are introducing the general function, later on we will include an admin section.
	-UserHome:  User connects to the userhome after loging in. As mentionned previously for the first iteration we are ainly focusing on the
outer layout later on the sections will be devided according to the user's status.
	-ChangePassword: Can be accessed from the homepage of the user, will be implemented in the future in such a way that the admin, also known 
in our case as the Librarian will be able to change everyones' password.
